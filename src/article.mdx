##  A booming industry

George is typical of thousands of victims working in the scam industry in Southeast Asia. In the last 30 years, the industry has gone global, raking in billions of dollars every year.

Exactly how much is hard to quantify. The The UN [estimates](https://www.unodc.org/roseap/en/2024/10/cyberfraud-industry-expands-southeast-asia/story.html) victims in East and Southeast Asia lost anywhere from A$28 to 59 billion in 2023. That same year Americans are [estimated](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/02/nationwide-fraud-losses-top-10-billion-2023-ftc-steps-efforts-protect-public) to have lost more than A$15.5 billion in investment scams alone.

The online scam industry started in Taiwan in the 1990s and quickly spread to China. In recent years new operations have sprung up across Cambodia, the Philippines, Myanmar and Laos, lured by lax regulation and local elites willing to turn a blind eye.

The scam factories also need high speed internet and office space and are often set up alongside casinos or online gambling operations.

In Cambodia's once-quiet coastal city of Sihanoukville the gambling industry [started taking off](https://globalchinapulse.net/sihanoukville-rise-and-fall-of-a-frontier-city/) in 2017.

By 2019, high-end hotels and condos dominated the skyline and gambling was generating billions a year for the local economy.

The Cambodian government [cracked down](https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3025687/how-cambodias-online-gambling-ban-sparked-great-chinese-exodus-2019) on online gambling in 2019 and many of these operators were shut down, leaving the scammers to take advantage of the deserted facilities.

A similar scenario played out in the Philippines after online gambling was [legalised](https://taiwaninsight.org/2021/02/04/going-to-paradise-the-online-gambling-industry-and-taiwanese-pogos-workers-in-the-philippines/) in 2016. Within a few years, many of these operations had become fronts for the scam industry, leading to a decision last year to [reinstate a ban](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/asia/philippines-pogos-ban-illegal-gambling-intl-hnk/index.html) on online gambling.

It's a different story in Myanmar. Gambling was long outlawed here, but some casinos did spring up in the areas on the Chinese and Thai borders controlled by armed ethnic groups. These areas became hubs for myriad criminal operations, including the scamming industry.

Scamming started to take hold alongside casinos in Myanmar too.

So far, we've identified more than 300 scamming sites across Cambodia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Laos. There are likely to be many more.

## Sophisticated operations run by shadowy figures

In recent years the scam industry has become increasingly professional. They've built bigger compounds, with offices, dormitories, shops, entertainment venues and other amenities for workers. Many have clubs similar to brothels, where young women provide sexual services to managers and scammers as a reward for good performances. 

Some now have departments overseeing operations, human resources and IT.

<HeirarchyGraphic />

It's hard to identify who is at the top of the hierarchy but it's clear that criminal figures and triad groups are involved. Scam compounds are also linked to local politicians and power brokers. In Cambodia police largely turn a blind eye to the industry. One officer [told](https://vodenglish.news/body-found-hanging-in-sihanoukvilles-alleged-slave-compound-area/) a local news agency in 2022: "These places don’t allow us to go in".

{/* <Pullquote className='' quote="At the gate you find 15 people manning the gate, then each office would have a security guard outside […] And during work, eight guards just sit there waiting for you. There’s no escaping." /> */}

When we were in Sihanoukville in 2022, the government launched a crackdown on the industry. We saw firsthand how quickly the compounds were evacuated. They had clearly been tipped off. 

Within months many of the scam centres were back in business.
